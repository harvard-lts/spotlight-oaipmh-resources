#Structure:
#
#  - spotlight-field: xxx (field names should be separated with dashes except for the suffix: firstpart-secondpart_ssim or _tesim)
#    multivalue-breaks: "yes" (optional) - use this for splitting out multiple values to be broken on (and faceted on) individually (ex - subjects)
#    default-value: xxx (optional)
#    delimiter: xxx (optional, what to separate all path values with.  Defaults to a space)
#    solr-field:
#        - field-name: xxx (repeatable - all path fields will be concatenated)
#
# Make sure to set unique-id_tesim if you want to choose an identifier for your record.
# Otherwise, reharvesting will result in the addition of more records rather than overwriting
# existing records.
